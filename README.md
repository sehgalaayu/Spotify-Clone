# ðŸŽµ Spotify Clone (HTML & CSS)

Welcome to my **Spotify Clone** project!  
This is a basic clone of Spotify's homepage UI, built **only using HTML and CSS**.  
I created this project to practice and apply everything I have learned so far about web development.

---

## ðŸš€ What I Used
- **HTML5**: for building the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: for styling and making the design responsive.
  
No JavaScript, libraries, or frameworks were used â€” just pure HTML and CSS!

## ðŸ“š What I Learned
- Structuring a complete web page using semantic HTML.
- Styling layouts using Flexbox and Grid.
- Working with positioning (`relative`, `absolute`) to build complex UI parts.
- Designing responsive sections.
- Using consistent fonts, colors, and spacings to match a real-world application.
